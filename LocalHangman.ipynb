        "## Solving Hangman with Statistical Letter Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to build a Hangman player that can guess hidden words with high accuracy using positional information.\n",
        "We begin by counting how many substrings occur at each position in the word, considering both forward (from the beginning) and backward (from the end) directions. The goal of utilizing these statistics is to capture common **prefix** and **suffix** patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "We combine scores from five different models—positional frequency, bigram, trigram, four-gram, and five-gram—into a single aggregated score, which is then used to determine the next letter guess. We next describe these five scoring schemes:\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Positional Score**\n",
        "We identify candidate words that match the current masked pattern, considering both prefix and suffix alignment. For each masked position, we compute a score for every letter based on how frequently it appears in that position across the matched words. These scores are then aggregated over all masked positions to compute a total score for each candidate letter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Bigram Score**\n",
        "For each masked position that is adjacent to a revealed letter, we consult bigram frequency statistics. We determine how often each candidate letter appears in that specific context—both when looking from the start and from the end of the word. Scores are aggregated across all such bigram contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Trigram Score**\n",
        "Similar to bigrams, we look at masked positions that are part of a substring containing two revealed neighboring letters. Using trigram frequency statistics, we score each letter based on how often it appears in that specific three-letter context. The final trigram score is computed by aggregating across all relevant positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Fourgram and Fivegram Score**\n",
        "The same process is extended to four-gram and five-gram contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "After computing all n-gram-based scores, we combine them using a **weighted sum**:\n",
        "- Higher-order n-grams (e.g., five-gram) are given **greater weight**\n",
        "- Lower-order n-grams (e.g., bigram) receive **less weight**\n",
        "- The **positional score** is also assigned a relatively high weight due to its strong predictive power\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Accuracy\n",
        "This combined scoring strategy achieved an accuracy of approximately **55–60%** depending on the held-out evaluation set.\n"
